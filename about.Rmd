I currently hold a masters of science degree in Biostatistics and Data Science from Cornell University and a masters of science degree in Integrated Immunology from University of Oxford. Prior to my masters degree, I graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biological Sciences with honors and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics-Economics with honors and distinction from the University at Buffalo. I have over seven years of work experience in virology research, biostatistics, public health/infectious diseases implementation, and vaccine development from the Galveston National Laboratory, Cornell University, and Biosafety Management Company where I worked on different scientific research projects and contributed to efforts to control the spread of COVID19. 
 
Current Work:
I founded the Biosafety Management Company and we provide consultancy services to state governments in Nigeria to enhance their COVID-19 response. Some of our projects include setting up infectious diseases laboratories and providing biosafety training to laboratory personnel.
